This is a modular adjustable Webcam mount for the Logitech c270.

Camera mount will require removal of the webcam's mount by removing the rubber screw covers, removing the screw and carefully removing the rod & bushing for reuse.

I also removed the front faceplate from mine so as to access the manual focus.

The middle sections are a smaller version of these: Cable Organizer the included file is already sized to work with this system.

I created a custom mount for my Hooklet 3D Odin One reprap printer, but I also included a generic base aswell.
