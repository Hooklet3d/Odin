Printed Parts BOM (notes)


=========================================================
This file outlines the parts needed to print an Odin One, 
here you can find notes on each part and quantity needed
=========================================================

**The settings below are only recommendations, this may change from printer-to-printer.  Use
these as a starting point and use your best judgement.  These settings were determined in Simplify 3D

======Frame Start========

-Frame-

-Base Side-
  -Quantity X2
  -Fill 30%
    -Layers-
      Base-2
      Outline-2
      Top -4

Notes:

The base side STL is large, make sure you are printing it on a full 200x200 build space
Depending on how you position the part you will want to make sure your build plate is properly 
aligned to prevent the printer from leaving the printspace.

-Base Front-
  -Quantity X1
    -Fill 40%
      -Layers-
        -Base-2
        -Outline-2
        -Top -4
        
Notes:

The Front STL is to be printed upside down, it has a large surface area so proper heatbed settings should be used to prevent 
warping.  

-Base Rear-
  -Quantity X1
    -Fill 40%
      -Layers-
        -Base-2
        -Outline-2
        -Top -4
        
Notes:

The Rear STL is to be printed upside down, it has a large surface area so proper heatbed settings should be used to prevent 
warping.
