## What's New

## May 2017

* Work continues on improving the included cooling solution (duct), currently the duct is effective but we do have some room to improve.  
* The team is focusing on producing kits and as we move into the summer show tour
* It's time to start looking into ways of improving the extruder solution and the x-axis; a key point of improvement is weight reduction.
* We are looking at making big improvements to the MK8 extruder as well, more on that to come!
* The current controller case solution is being updated and improved as of now.
